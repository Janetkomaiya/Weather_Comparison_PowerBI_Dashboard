# 🌤 Lagos vs Toronto Weather Dashboard (Oct–Nov 2025)

## 📊 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard compares **Lagos** and **Toronto** weather patterns over a two-week period (Oct–Nov 2025).  

Designed to reveal climate contrasts between tropical and temperate regions, the dashboard transforms raw weather data into actionable insights through interactive visuals.

From average temperatures to rainfall intensity, this project demonstrates how data visualization bridges geography and climate understanding.
